              @whispermeforever Send me a DM, and if I feel like I can create
              with you, I will give you a reply. I can't work with every single
              one of you. There has to be interest both ways otherwise it won't
              be fun at all.

              I usually come up with ideas, or if you have an idea, I'll
              definitely try to work with you. A lot of it is just freestyling
              and mostly coming up with things on the spot. I never left a shoot
              without at least some photos that I didn't like so far.

              No I do not. I'm actually a Software Engineer, but a Digital Nomad
              Lifestyle got me into creatives and allowed me to experience
              variety of things in life. Yet, I do have a passion in this area
              as well as Interior Design.

              I self taught and I played with cameras here and there for about
